Reviews"I feel so LUCKY to have found this used (phone to us & not used hard at all), phone on line from someone who upgraded and sold this one. My Son liked his old one that finally fell apart after 2.5+ years and didn't want an upgrade!! Thank you Seller, we really appreciate it & your honesty re: said used phone.I recommend this seller very highly & would but from them again!!""nice phone, nice up grade from my pantach revue. Very clean set up and easy set up. never had an android phone but they are fantastic to say the least. perfect size for surfing and social media. great phone samsung"The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in."Had this phone before and loved it but was not working so I got this phone. One thing is the SD card slot does not open up when I try to access it in file managment, even does not show up on the computer. The card is fine was able to open on another phone. Trying to trouble shoot it for now.""the reasons for the 3 star rating was it was in my opinion better than my iphone 4s but it tends to randomly crash, and randomly power off but it is good for storage space, battery usage, and camera""Just... not good. The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop."excellent product in perfect conditionexcellent"But p30 pro is fully supported by Google, the unsupported devices is p40 and matte 30."So you haf wrong opinion"Too expensive if you want a midranger, and under specced if you want a flagship...S10 and A70 are good enough"Dissapointedi like a smaller screen dont really want a phablet or anything wider than 7 cmShut on my Fonwhy don't you make an option to view inbox with gRid view.This will much betteR to see in gRid view with contatc icons.it waas an amejing expurience__"Ise Logo ke bajese he To TikTok Zinda haiAare ban kardo re koi tiktok ko _"Samsung are you so much afraid of my memes in yesterday post you guys removed all the memes and gif from the post _So finally update is available..__I hope there wont me more issues that we are already facing..__"Really, it has to stop.Releasing almost around 30-50 Smartphones per year around various price segments is just out right diastrous for the users. Because  if you see, in just within 20k rupees (according to Samsung store pricing) we have J SERIES, A SERIES, M SERIES (j2, a10, a20, a30, a50, A51, m30, m20, j7 pro, j7 max, j7duo, j7) They are almost similarly performing with a price gap of ~1-2k.By releasing these many mobiles, you may believe they are giving plenty of options for you to choose from, but they aren't. Cons of having these many mobiles is     > Disastrous software update support(m31 software brick issue, j7max not getting Android pie, etc..)      > Build Quality Issues like with j7 pro display problems. Let me explain,Now I'm using a S series, so I don't have to worry about software support for alteast 2 years(hope so) Every year high end 'S series' have normally 3 phones, so they can provide the software updates quickly compared to the rest.Previously I used to have J7MAX, which costs around 18k and came with android 7(nougat) at my time of purchase,Can you imagine when I got my oreo update?2019!Yes you heard it right, oreo was officially released on 2017, but I received it on 2019.If you think that's worse, I don't even got the android 9 pie update! Means samsung didn't even hold on to it's 2 year guaranteed updates._ All they give us now is a security update/4-5 months. What I Mean to say is ""What do I get by buying the J7 MAX?""Yup, I got the mobile for my exact budget in that year~18k._But in the end, I got switched up to another mobile (S10e),_ But in samsung defence, yes it still gives the good battery backup. But what's the use of it, when we don't have the good software to run ____. There are literally tons of bugs in the j7 max(you can check their community threads to know some) they have to alteast give the device some software updates(Android 9 should be least they can give the device). There in lies the main problem, How can they give us  the updates, if they are so busy in releasing new phones? (who knows there may be a new B SERIES AND C SERIES(already exists ha__) in works). What I advise samsung is to, release max of 4-5 mobiles/year in the budget segment, just like they do with the flagships, but not flooding the market. The optimum price segments can be:1. <7k, 2. ~10k3. ~15k4. ~20kAnd give those devices the good software support. Take the apple for example, IPhone 6s which released back in 2014, runs ios13, that is almost 5 years of software upgrades, and is even supposed to receive the ios14. Now as a customer, you may feel you got the device at your exact  budget.But in the end, it's so disappointing, because the samsung literally scraps our devices after an year, so you ending up buying new phone, which costs even more.Take me for example, for my budget of 18k then,in that ocean of phones(not to mention those Chinese brands like vivo, OPPO, realme, their Smartphones list are endless_)I bought the J7 Max. And I used it for 1-1.5 years, and I bought a new one. If samsung can streamline its budget segment mobiles then and I have options only to choose between 15 and 20k, and  is providing good software support, who knows, may be  I would have put that extra 2k then, may be still using my j7 max(because the j7max battery life is way better than the current s10 series, j7 max is only becoming worse because of its software bugs and lack of updates) and would have saved s10 money. So, If the samsung can some how streamline it's  mobile release and to some how convince its customers to pay that 2k upfront and provide the good software updates and ensuring the good build qualities for the mobiles , it can be real good for consumers, in the long run. These are plainly my views, hope many of you guys agree with me.

Company is going to call what they want to call it doesn't matter you agree or not ."Hello Community Members, anyone interested in purchasing S10+, decided to sell it for the below reasons: 1. Exynos Chipset: The worst chip ever in any smartphone. Why the fxxk Samsung uses Exynos chips for Indian market, even though India is the biggest market for any smartphone companies.  Cons of Exynos chip: - Worst battery performance -  Camera quality and image processing is extremely poor in comparison to Snapdragon chipset.- Performance is average, similar to phones with range 18k INR- Phone dialler speed is extremely slow- Apps like Paytm gets crash most of the times- Heavy games like Pubg faces extreme lag and **bleep** drops on highest settings. - Feels like using some chinese phones. Performance and camera is similar to Redmi Note series...2. Doesn't feel like using premium flagship phone after spending 75K INR. 3. Redmi Note 8 pro has the same camera quality in 90% cases, seriously samsung??4. File processing, data retrieving and processing types of tasks are extremely slow because of Exynos versions.  5. Poor chip quality results into phone heating. 6. Atleast 2 times  a day charging is required even when set on Medium Power Saving mode. 7. For Optimised and High speed mode, phone doesn't last for more than 6-7 hours.Even S20 series is facing the same problems and all the smartphone experts have the same opinion regarding camera and exynos chipset. Pls improve urself if u really want to compare ur phone with Apple and Huawei.  We will boycott all the upcoming Samsung S and Note series if they will be using Exynos version in it. #BoycottExynosChipset #StopExynosInIndia #StopFooling"Fuckin Samsung my ass. There features are rubbish. Most of the time it hangs. Pathetic display quality ...... WHAT !! did you really brought Samsung Galaxy S10 lite original one or copy one complaining about display is so lame the company which makes best display and btw that one is in your phone. I don't think the person who is complaining display is sure shot about audio and battery life. Coming to cell reception I didn't find any problem with it I'm using worst network (voda) . I didn't found any single bug on my phone. I'm not into much photography but saw comparison video and yes in some parts op7t was good(day shots) but night shots were worst. Stop spreading fake review.The back camera is somewhat good but the front camera just sucks. Although I am impressed with the battery life of this phone"Does S10 lite has ip68 rating???Or waterproof and dust resistant????"Have you got any response/information on this?Can we connect 1TB external hard disk to this phone?Is it possible to have bootloader unlocked and root access?

It's bigger, HEAVIER than the S10. Its specs are also more powerful in several key areas not weaker. They should've called it S10.5 at most, but in reality it's an entirely different device than the S10. They should've called it S11 or something (they did jump a bunch of S's because.. marketing? &#129300;).

I own the prism blue variant and it gets the job done right. All the things you mentioned can be easily taken care by the Snapdragon 855 (The 855+ is for hardcore gamers) but nonetheless the S10 Lite can easily handle any game you throw at it. I bought the phone in February and I haven't noticed any heating or lag as yet. It delivers flagship like experience at a lesser price.The things you'll miss out compared to the Oneplus 7T are:- Glass back construction (Makes the phone fragile and since 7T does not have wirelesscharging, I don't see the use.)- The 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery quick considering 7T has a 3800 mAh battery.- Stereo speakers- Snapdragon 855+- Telephoto lens"Thanx .

Something better than the note 9 but less powerful than the note 10.. something in between. The note 10 lite looks freaking ugly and rushed specs.For the Galaxy s10 lite they could have done the same... have the same overall design + 855 processor, bigger battery and the size to be bigger than the s10. with all this features, head phone jack, make it special in some way that it stands out - have matte finish color at the back instead of the gloss or a all screen display with a flip out camera like oneplus. Would have loved to see it in the s10 design.For now both this phones look crap.. id rater wait some months and by the s10 or get the note 9 as prices have dropped. Even the one plus 7 pro looks better with the all screen and 90hrz display""there should be a shortcut key for torch opening like as we have double click for camera. in emergency or when torch actually required we don't have time to unlock mobile, then open torch. something like triple click home button or double click power button. this will be quiet useful."In display we should have option of call end key lights"Edge lighting is for notifications.

System semiconductors increased profits by expanding supply of mobile parts for major customers.In the DP division, small- and medium-sized panels lost profits QoQ due to the off-season, but deficit narrowed slightly for large-sized panels due to a slowdown in selling prices.In the IM division, sales volume decreased due to the global spread of Corona19 at the end of the quarter, but profits increased QoQ and YoY due to improved product mix and efficient marketing expenses following the launch of flagships such as the S20.The CE division's earnings decreased QoQ due to the off-peak season and corona19.The Haman division suffered significantly from the previous quarter due to the large impact of one-time costs related to the relocation of factories in Europe.In relation to the 1Q welcome sentiment, the strong dollar and the euro had a positive impact on the parts business, but major growth market currencies were weaker than the won and the overall operating profit was insignificant.[2Q and 2H outlook]In 2Q, earnings are expected to drop QoQ as the effect of Corona19 on the demand for major products is in full swing.In the parts business, memory and server and PC demand are expected to remain solid, but the risk of slowing mobile demand remains. OLED earnings are expected to weaken due to the sluggish smartphone market.In the set business, sales and performance of major products are expected to drop sharply due to shrinking demand from Corona 19, store closures, and plant shutdowns.Haman is expected to continue its weak earnings amid the temporary shutdown of global auto factories.High uncertainties related to Corona19 will likely continue in 2H.In the case of the parts business, memory will strengthen technological leadership and cost competitiveness through micro-process conversion, and OLED plans to actively expand new applications while responding to new product demand.In the case of the set business, we plan to continue preparing innovative products that will further enhance the consumer experience.Wireless plans to actively promote lineups such as foldable and note new products and mid / low-priced 5G expansion.The CE division plans to promote efficient marketing and promotion considering market conditions by country.[Facilities Investment]Facility investment in the first quarter was about 7.3 trillion won, which is 6 trillion won for semiconductors and 0.8 trillion won for displays by business.Memory continues to invest in expansion and process conversion as previously planned, and foundries have been focused on expanding to respond to EUV microprocess demand.[Details by section]_ SemiconductorSemiconductors posted sales of 17.64 trillion won and operating profit of 3.99 trillion won in the first quarter.In the first quarter, despite seasonal seasonality and the spread of Corona19, profits improved slightly as server- and PC-oriented demand remained strong and mobile demand continued due to increased telecommuting and online education.The risk of slowing mobile demand will remain in 2Q, but demand for servers and PCs is expected to continue, and solid demand is expected to be maintained across applications.Samsung Electronics will focus on expanding the demand for high-capacity, high-value-added server SSDs with more than 2TB, and plans to secure cost competitiveness by expanding the 5th generation V-NAND conversion.The memory market in the second half is highly uncertain due to Corona19, but demand for high-end and high-performance memory is expected to continue to grow as new lifestyles based on online services rapidly spread.Samsung Electronics plans to focus on strengthening technological leadership and cost competitiveness by accelerating the fine process conversion, such as 1z nano DRAM and 6th generation V-NAND, while flexibly adjusting investment and product-specific production proportions according to market fluctuations.In 1Q, the system LSI business increased QoQ with the expansion of supply of 5G mobile processors and ultra-high-resolution image sensors with the launch of a new premium smartphone model in 2020.In 2Q, overall demand is expected to contract due to Corona19, and the company plans to expand supply centering on 5G System on Chip (SoC) and premium image sensors.In the second half of the year, it plans to launch new products with competitive edge and expand new applications.In the first quarter, 5G and image sensor chip demand increased, but earnings declined QoQ due to the decline in Chinese High Performance Computing (HPC) demand.In the second quarter, the company plans to expand its EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet) process leadership by mass-producing 5 nanometers and continue to promote product orders for processes below 5 nanometers.In the second half, we continue to invest in fine processes with diversification of applications for consumer and computing, secure competitiveness through full-scale mass production and improvement of 5 nano FinFET process, and GAA (Gate-All-Around) 3 nano process It will also continue to develop._ Display PanelIn the display business, sales in the first quarter were 6.59 trillion won and operating profit was 0.29 trillion won.The 1Q display business fell QoQ due to a decrease in overall panel sales.The small and medium-sized display business in 2Q is expected to deteriorate due to a decrease in customer demand, but will focus on improving sales based on differentiated product performance and design.In the large display business, the market is expected to stagnate due to the delay of global sports events.In the second half of the year, there is uncertainty over the recovery of demand in the small and medium-sized display business, but plans to secure leadership by expanding the market for new products such as foldable smartphones.In the large-scale display business, the LCD line will shrink, but it will continue to develop new technology-based products by responding seamlessly to customer demand._ IM (IT & Mobile Communications)In the first quarter, the IM division recorded sales of 26 trillion won and operating profit of 2.65 trillion won.In the wireless business, smartphone sales decreased QoQ due to the spread of Corona 19 at the end of the quarter, butprofits improved QoQ and YoY thanks to flagship product launches such as the Galaxy S20 · Z Flip and efficient marketing operations .In the second quarter, as global demand contracts due to the spread of Corona 19 in earnest, earnings are inevitable, and plans to strengthen the online and B2B channels and promote cost efficiency.In addition, it plans to respond flexibly to market demands by actively utilizing diversified global manufacturing capabilities.In the second half of the year, demand uncertainties still exist, and competition between companies to make up for sluggish performance in the first half is expected to intensify.Samsung Electronics plans to strengthen the competitiveness of the entire lineup by releasing premium new models such as foldable notes and mid-to-low-priced 5G and improving overall operational efficiency such as production, supply, channel, and marketing.In the first quarter, the network business improved QoQ in line with the expansion of 5G commercialization at home and abroad.Although there are uncertainties such as delayed or reduced 5G investments at home and abroad due to the impact of Corona 19 in the second quarter and the second half, Samsung Electronics plans to secure technological competitiveness and strengthen its global capabilities to strengthen its mid- to long-term 5G business base._ CE (Consumer Electronics)In the first quarter, the CE division recorded sales of 10.3 trillion won and operating profit of 0.45 trillion won.The TV business saw a decrease in performance compared to the previous quarter and the previous year due to the seasonal low season and the influence of Corona 19, but by expanding the sales of QLED, ultra-large and lifestyle TVs, it expanded market share in the premium TV marketand solidified its leadership.The TV market in 2Q is expected to contract from the previous year due to the worsening market conditions and postponed global sports events, and plans to actively respond to online purchase demand by expanding online promotions and lineup operations.For consumers who prefer content consumption, it plans to expand sales of ultra-large and QLED 8K TVs based on ultra-high definition and vivid sound, and provide a differentiated consumer experience based on smart TV features such as homeschooling and home office.In the first quarter of the year, the home appliance business saw a slight improvement compared to the previous year due to strong sales of premium products such as Grande AI washing machines and dryers, while demand for global home appliances decreased.In the second quarter, it plans to focus on responding to the crisis by continuously strengthening online sales, cooperating with distributors, and optimizing marketing strategies.In the second half of the year, the global TV and consumer electronics market is likely to have high uncertainties, such as the possibility of a global economic downturn, but we plan to focus on minimizing sales disruptions by efficiently operating marketing and optimizing logistics operations in consideration of country-specific situations.[Related to Corona 19]Samsung Electronics puts top priority on the health and safety of its employees and their families, composes Corona 19-response T / Fs for regional managers at home and abroad, and takes appropriate and quick responses in accordance with the latest guidelines published by national health authorities.In addition, Samsung Electronics is working closely with major partners to solve various issues arising from Corona 19 while sharing information.And we are doing our best to provide customers with stable products and services by flexibly utilizing Samsung Electronics' global production base and supply chain.In addition, donations, medical supplies, electronic products and devices for online education were supported by countries around the world to actively participate in the government and community efforts to overcome Corona19. In Korea, thecompany provides facilities to be used as a treatment center, and technology is provided to domestic mask production companies.In addition, all employees are contemplating ways to further contribute to customers and communities based on the company's skills and capabilities.In terms of performance, Samsung Electronics achieved solid results despite difficult business conditions in the first quarter.However, as Corona 19 began to spread globally from March, production and sales disruption and demand contraction continued due to the shutdown of some production facilities and the closure of distribution networks, supply chains, and offline stores.As a result, the second quarter is expected to have difficulties centering on the set business, and uncertainties remain in the second half.Samsung Electronics will closely monitor the situation and focus on minimizing the impact on business and customers through flexible and prompt responses based on technological leadership and product competitiveness.In addition, after the Corona 19 issue has passed, Samsung Electronics will do its best to prepare for future sustainable growth, such as enhancing the competitiveness of its flagship business and strategic R & D investment."finally a great phone from Samsung. best thing in this phone is the dual Sim and SD card support and great cameras. this phone should have been the best if they removed the front camera notch. also Samsung reduced the resolution to mid range and that's a very bad thing even thought Samsung need $650 for this phone."i agree, i dont see how make sanse , to pay this over 500 dolars, when we have now s10 plus, around 600, dolaras, meybe in few months, when come out s11, and other phones, this phone drop high in price, meybe then only be wort to buy.""Too expensive if you want a midranger, and under specced if you want a flagship...S10 and A70 are good enough"There is 4k 60fps this device"great and amazing phone, would love to use it when it comes"Samsung is switching most of its flagship models to snapdragon chips for a few years until their exynos versions are improved. Galaxy s20 will be getting snapdragon chipset.As the manufacturing place is close to my friend's place the delivery is faster there. Now it depends upon my location as to when I'll receive my order?"Pros:- Snapdragon 855 is quite snappy and makes the animation smooth.- RAM management is excellent and 8GB RAM is more than enough for multitasking.- A gorgeous AMOLED display panel and you get used to the puch-hole display.- A good quality highly polished plastic back that mimics glass but is more durable.- The in hand feel is premium because the phone has an Aluminium frame.- The OneUI 2.0 on top of Android 10 is quite good in terms of sofware experience.- The phone will be receiving monthly security updates just like Samsung flagships.- In the storage benchmark tests the phone performs equal to UFS 3.0.- The camera setup is very capable, both in terms of photo and video quality.- A flat display means no accidental touches.- Extremly thin bezels around the screen and HDR 10+ makes content watching a treat tothe eyes.- An excellent battery backup, getting 1.5 days of usage on a single charge.- The in-box 25W charger is fast enough to fill up the phone in 1hr and 10 mins.Cons:- No stereo speakers, which definitely better sounding than the mono speaker on boardthis phone.- No IP certification for water or dust resistance but there is a rubber ring around the SIMtray and inside the speaker grill. (Saw the speaker grill rubber in a disassmebly video.)- No headphone jack, but the in-box USB-C earphones are decent. (Not the AKG ones withthe S10 or Note 10 series.) Also, buying a set of wireless headphones a smarter choice.- A telephoto lens would've made it more versatile but the 5MP macro camera is prettydecent and pictures come out nice and detailed in good lighting conditions.- No wireless charging but that's not a deal breaker because wireless charging is still afairly new concept to the general public.- A polycarbonate back, which Samsung calls glastic (glass + palstic). It is more prone toscratches compared to a glass back but in turn it is much more durable. Since, there is nowireless charging, it won't make much of a difference.All things considered the S10 Lite is fantastic piece of hardware loaded with most flagship specs and a very good UI at a fairly decent price.There you go mate!""Excited with the price details, when I looked into tech specifics 2 things are bothering me1. Optical fingerprint sensor. Who on Earth is going to press power key and then give their finger print every time to unlock a phone. Face unlock is present but there are many cases where you need fingerprint and moreover that also requires you to press power button. I badly miss ultrasonic sensor available in S10+2. Camera. Don't fall for the MegaPixel numbers. It is the aperture length that matters. Lower the aperture better the light capturing capability. My S7 has better aperture than S10 lite. Other wise its a great deal for 38k INR. But still not my cup of cake!""What they should have done for the note 10 lite is to have the same design as fagship note 10 but in a smaller form factor + with the cheaper glastic material with the pen, 855 processor and a headphone jack. Something better than the note 9 but less powerful than the note 10.. something in between. The note 10 lite looks freaking ugly and rushed specs.For the Galaxy s10 lite they could have done the same... have the same overall design + 855 processor, bigger battery and the size to be bigger than the s10. with all this features, head phone jack, make it special in some way that it stands out - have matte finish color at the back instead of the gloss or a all screen display with a flip out camera like oneplus. Would have loved to see it in the s10 design.For now both this phones look crap.. id rater wait some months and by the s10 or get the note 9 as prices have dropped. Even the one plus 7 pro looks better with the all screen and 90hrz display""Hello Community Members, anyone interested in purchasing S10+, decided to sell it for the below reasons: 1. Exynos Chipset: The worst chip ever in any smartphone. Why the fxxk Samsung uses Exynos chips for Indian market, even though India is the biggest market for any smartphone companies.  Cons of Exynos chip: - Worst battery performance -  Camera quality and image processing is extremely poor in comparison to Snapdragon chipset.- Performance is average, similar to phones with range 18k INR- Phone dialler speed is extremely slow- Apps like Paytm gets crash most of the times- Heavy games like Pubg faces extreme lag and *bleep* drops on highest settings. - Feels like using some chinese phones. Performance and camera is similar to Redmi Note series...2. Doesn't feel like using premium flagship phone after spending 75K INR. 3. Redmi Note 8 pro has the same camera quality in 90% cases, seriously samsung??4. File processing, data retrieving and processing types of tasks are extremely slow because of Exynos versions.  5. Poor chip quality results into phone heating. 6. Atleast 2 times  a day charging is required even when set on Medium Power Saving mode. 7. For Optimised and High speed mode, phone doesn't last for more than 6-7 hours.Even S20 series is facing the same problems and all the smartphone experts have the same opinion regarding camera and exynos chipset. Pls improve urself if u really want to compare ur phone with Apple and Huawei.  We will boycott all the upcoming Samsung S and Note series if they will be using Exynos version in it. "its supporting 5G or Notwhat r best trending games these days"<p>Hi Guys, my s10 is 5 months old, i have observed that my<b> s10</b> charging very slow from last 2 weeks.

They've destroyed all the upper mid-range phones that had glass on aluminum body frames and replaced it with plastic devices. They've also removed the FM and NFC from the upper mid-range devices. The Gorilla glass version on these phones is probably version three. I have not seen any of their devices that have plastic bodies with Gorilla Glass 4 or above. Who will spend $650 for these plastics?you should give marshmallow in this device..... like geoni…at this time when apple growing unreasonably Samsung need a glowing logo and logo is star according to the meaning of Samsung three starHuge cheating by Samsung No Embedded Sim option coming on scanning QR code from mobile operator After scanning This pops up instead of add plan in sim card manager"I've seen a few comparisons between these two devices. In all of those comparisons, the Samsung has much better RAM management and app opening times. Even in video rendering S10 lite is much faster. And the camera is far superior than RoG. So consider buying RoG if the only thing that you'll be doing is gaming as a secondary device otherwise this device is far superior compared to the RoG in doing everyday tasks. You won't like using it in daily for a long time. You'll be getting much less for your money if you're only buying the RoG phone as a phone and not for the extention support."Then Go and Buy Poco.. And After 1 or 2 year phone hardware will be degraded much lower in comparison to samsung device .. poco and all are good for short durability wheras samsung are long race horse.. quality matter(in glass too)Atleast samsung don't show those funky ad like miui in poco"How the f can this be called an ""S10 Lite""? It's bigger, HEAVIER than the S10. Its specs are also more powerful in several key areas not weaker. They should've called it S10.5 at most, but in reality it's an entirely different device than the S10. They should've called it S11 or something (they did jump a bunch of S's because.. marketing? &#129300;). What a joke!"I hope this price only for display and new ois &#128148;"Edge display is not in s10 lite version....&#129301;&#128524;&#9785;_Disappointed &#128545;&#128555;"
